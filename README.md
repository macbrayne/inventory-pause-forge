# Pause your single player game when inventories are open.
This is an ongoing port of [umollu's inventory-pause mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-pause) to forge which is currently fabric only.
It supports pausing on opening the inventory, opening furnaces, crafting tables, shulker boxes and experimental configurable support for other mods.


This mod is 1.16.5 (and 1.17 when forge updates) only and won't be backported to 1.12.
